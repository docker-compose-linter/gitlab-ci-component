# DCLint Component for GitLab

[![GitLab Release](https://img.shields.io/gitlab/v/release/dclint%2Fci-component?style=for-the-badge&logo=gitlab)](https://gitlab.com/dclint/ci-component/-/releases)

This GitLab CI/CD component automates Docker Compose linting using
[DCLint](https://github.com/zavoloklom/docker-compose-linter).

It runs `dclint` and publishes a
[Code Quality Report](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/testing/code_quality/#view-code-quality-results) compatible with GitLab
Merge Request UI.

> The source code is hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dclint/ci-component). Although there is an automatic mirror
> of this repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/docker-compose-linter/gitlab-ci-component), all bug reports, feature
> requests, and merge requests should be submitted through GitLab.

## DCLint Features

- **Error Detection**: Identifies syntax errors and common issues in Docker Compose files.
- **Style Enforcement**: Enforces best practices and style guidelines for maintainable configurations.
- **Flexible Integration**: Can be used locally, in Docker, or integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
- **Configurable Rules**: Customize the linter's behavior and rules according to your project's needs.
- **Auto-fixable Rules**: Some rules include an auto-fix mode, allowing you to automatically format and correct certain
  issues in your files.
- **Comments Support**: After automated sorting and fixing, comments remain in the correct place, ensuring no important
  information is lost during the formatting process.
- **Anchor Support:** Supports YAML anchors for shared configuration sections, with some limitations.

## Usage Example

```yml
include:
  - component: $CI_SERVER_FQDN/dclint/ci-component/dclint@v1.0.0
```

> üí° Requires GitLab 16.8 or later
